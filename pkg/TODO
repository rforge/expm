* TODO expm() should work for sparse matrices for more methods
* expAtv(A, v, t)
** TODO should work for *vector* t
** TODO should implement the new method by  Al-Mohy and Higham (2011),
   see file:Misc/README  and  file:Misc/expmv/

* TODO Implement  Higham (2009)  {we have 2008} :  see file:inst/doc/expm.bib

* TODO dgebal() -- now renamed to balance() == Matlab name,
  *but* add the functionality (available in Matlab) to also return the
  transforming diagonal matrix D --> file:R/balance.R


* TODO Rmpfr version possible (s.Pade.s), as soon as solve() for Rmpfr
