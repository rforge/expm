* expm() should work for sparse matrices for more methods

* expAtv(A, v, t)   should work for *vector* t

* Implement  Higham (2009)  {we have 2008} :  see   file:inst/doc/expm.bib

* dgebal() -- now renamed to balance() == Matlab name,
  *but* add the functionality (available in Matlab) to also return the
  transforming diagonal matrix D --> file:R/balance.R


* Rmpfr version possible (s.Pade.s), as soon as solve() for Rmpfr
